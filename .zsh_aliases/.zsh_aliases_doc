# Documentation for zsh aliases

This file documents the purpose and usage of each alias and function in `.zsh_aliases`.

- `cp`, `mv`, `rm`: Safer, interactive versions of core commands.
- `mk`, `rd`: Directory creation and removal helpers.
- `md`: Make and cd into a directory.
- `wtf`: Show prompt help.
- `ml.dir`: Move and link dotfiles.
- `h`, `j`: History and jobs helpers.

Add more documentation as needed for new aliases and functions.
